I’ve been procrastinating. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had a fairly productive
couple of days: I solved all of [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) thus
far, either in [Carp](//blog.veitheller.de/Carp.html) or
[zepto](https://github.com/zepto-lang/zepto); I contributed a few things to
Carp; I wrote a [snake clone in it](https://github.com/hellerve/reptile); I
produced an unusually torrentous amount of [art](https://veitheller.de/art);
and I’ve been more active on this blog than I have been for a long time.

But I haven’t made any progress on what I’ve set out to do: make a ring. I want
to explore why that is in this blog post, for I think it’s a fairly common
phenomenon in the projects I’m working on, and it’s entirely unhealthy, both
for me and for the projects themselves.

## The fear is real

I’m an angsty person. Regular readers of my blog will know, I’ve always been
upfront with it. I’m lucky enough to have a readership that either enjoys
reading those posts or doesn’t care and just waits it out until I write about
Lisp and C and weird hacks again. I’m also lucky enough to not having to
monetize this blog, and so I can just write what I want, and if people enjoy
it, that’s great, and if not, no hard feelings.

This is not true for a lot of other projects I’m working on: people depend on
them, or they pay me to work on them, or, most recently, it is a token that our
primitive cultures require for a bond. I’ve been assured that it’s not a
problem if I don’t get this ring done, but my conscience cannot be fooled by
even the most masterful sleight of hand.

I regularly abandon projects; they pile up behind me, not unlike lost lovers or
estranged friends. My code is very close to me, it feels closer than some of
my human relationships: when I leave it behind, it’s always a goodbye.

That’s utterly unprofessional, and yet I cannot help it but think of the things
I have begun and not finished, like I think of people I know from high school,
asking myself what they’re up to now. The only difference is, for the code I
know the answer; it’s still in the dark, damp cell I left it in, slowly
bitrotting.

I really wish this was more of a hyperbole. I really wish that I didn’t feel
this way in my dark moments, because I not only feel like a failure, I feel
disgustingly treacherous, a tech-savvy snakeoil salesman.

And so I present these little visual distractions instead, in an effort to make
this seem like I’m being productive. This is what I do: if there is a project I
really have to finish, chances are that I won’t finish it properly. I’m too
afraid of not getting it done, and I’m appalled by the manual work, the trial
and error required to _really_ get it to work.

Right now I should be trying to get the 3D printer to work, to print some
sketches, and then generate a good 3D model that my fiancée and I can wear to
see if what I did was a colossal failure. Instead I’m telling you about
my angst, making you complicit in this game of procrastination. How does that
make you feel?

I’m annoyed at how manual 3D printing seems, how much of it is just wait and
see and recalibrate. I could rant about that, but that’s really not what it’s
about: it’s about my inability to do anything that isn’t fun. That’s not
healthy, and it is only getting worse. As my career progresses, and I’m slowly
getting a reputation, and I’m building projects, I more and more get to pick
and choose and I lose my ability to bear anything.

(If a recruiter happens to read this: this is what you’re trying to sell your
clients. Better stay back.)

My parents didn’t spoil me, and I didn’t have a lot of money until I started
working in tech. Now that I do, I can feel it corrupting me. But this is a
story for another day.

There is so much here that I could talk about more, and I want to talk about
none of it.

So now for the happy ending: I’m still fairly happy with my output, and I’m
learning to live with my conscience. But this is what I think in my darkest
hours, and in a spectacular case of bad judgement I decided to make it public.
You’ve probably read my stuff, you know how I am. Don’t worry, I’ll be fine.
