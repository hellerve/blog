I find it hard to talk about the work that I’m doing at feenk, working on
[Glamorous Toolkit](gtoolkit.com/), in the “dead” medium of a blog post.
Consequently, I haven’t written much about anything I’ve done in a long, long
while.

That doesn’t mean I haven’t done stuff, however! To prove it—and to bridge the
gap until I can figure out how to write about things in a more “live” fashion
that better suits my current work—here’s a recording of a talk I gave on a
Carp IDE I implemented in a few weekends in Glamorous Toolkit. It’s from last
year, but the recording only became available two weeks ago.

I have some other things I want to talk about, however, and that I know how to
present if I find the time to do so. So maybe I’ll finally write a real blog
post again soon? No promises, though.
