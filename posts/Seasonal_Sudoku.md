As many of you know I recently concluded a six-part series on Sudoku solvers in
which we implemented Sudoku solvers in six different programming languages. I had
a ton of fun with the series, but it left me feeling like I barely scratched the surface. There are so many cool languages out there that I want to get my grubby
little hands on and play with!

So I decided to [make it a real series](http://blog.veitheller.de/sss/index.html).
Each season will have six episodes, and the series we just concluded will be
ret-conned into being the first season instead. So far I mapped out three seasons
of increasing obscurity. I have a pretty good idea of how I’ll tackle all the
languages in season two, but thinking about some of the implementations for
season three gives me sweaty fingers already, which is more than exciting.

Take a look at the list and [let me know what you think](mailto:veit@veitheller.de)!
Did I forget anything? D you have any favorite languages I should add? Will we
need a fourth season? Who will make it through this entire series with me?
