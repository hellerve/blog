When I [announced my new work as an independent technologist](https://blog.veitheller.de/Spirited_Away.html),
I also presented [my new rates](https://veitheller.de/at-large/#rates). Most
notably, I will be giving 100€ of my 800€ daily rate for open source projects
to charities. The obvious questions is which charities I will support using
your money, and this blog post is an attempt to answer that question.

## Give Well

[Give Well](https://www.givewell.org/) is a nonprofit that helps prospective
chariteers<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> choose effective charities. I’ve used
it in the past to choose charities, and I found the information helpful; after
all, while I want the money that I donate to matter, I’m not an expert on
charities. I decided to let them guide my decisions again, and I’ll probably
stick with them in the future.

As such, the money that I will be donating in the coming months and years will
go to two charities fighting malaria, the [Malaria
Consortium](https://www.malariaconsortium.org/) and the [Against
Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/). These two charities have
very different approaches to fighting the disease: while the Malaria Consortium
focuses on preventing and treating malaria and other similarly problematic
diseases, such as Dengue and Pneumonia, the foundation Against Malaria focuses
specifically on distributing insecticidal nets. I believe that those two
approaches work very well together, so I’ve decided to support both of them.

## Finally

If you know of other charities that you want to share with me, [let me
know](mailto:charities@veitheller.de)! Of course you can also write to me if you think
that I might be missing something about the charities I am already donating to.

I will update this blog post if and when the set of charities I’m supporting
changes.
