I’ve never experienced a company with a completely healthy performance review
culture. To be fair, it’s quite likely that my sample size is just skewed.
Still, [giving feedback well is tricky](https://blog.veitheller.de/Feedback_Sans_Sandwiches.html),
and performance reviews always have the added complexities of introducing a power
dynamic and being fundamentally transactional. Not the coziest starting point.

And yet there is room for a middle ground between pretending it’s a coffee chat
between friends and a professional colonoscopy. On paper, performance reviews
should work great for both parties: the manager gets to help propel the report
into a position as a more productive member of the team, and the report learns
what is expected of them to reach the next stage of growth and compensation—or
sometimes just avoiding getting terminated.

Mandatory disclaimer: my background is not in HR. I’m reporting what has worked
for me, as well as some wishful thinking that I hope is still actionable. As
always, my bias is towards small to medium-sized teams.

## A working definition

We need to start defining stuff before we get into the weeds, so here goes: a
performance review is a periodic written summary of impact and behaviors over
a defined time window, plus an agreed growth plan. It is often accompanied by an
in-person check-in, but doesn’t have to be.

It is not a compensation negotiation (which is related but separate), a [stack
ranking ritual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve), or a place to
air our grievances from the last six months. We don’t just collect feedback so
we can shove it into a two-page document about all our latest failings, ideally
we have a better process for giving quick, actionable, kind feedback.

So, what do we want to achieve, then?

### Goals of a good review

After the performance review is done, we want to feel aligned and ready to tackle
the next period of work as an even better team. To do this, we need to strive for
**clarity** in our communication, **fairness** in our evaluation, and stay
**actionable**. Let’s go through these in turn.

**Clarity** is achieved by avoiding hedging while staying kind. Hopefully there
are no surprises anyway, since your company has an ongoing feedback culture and
avoids in-office politics that reward backstabbing and careerism, right? On the
off chance that there is a political component, we do our best to stay
evidence-based and bring receipts.

This brings us to **fairness** immediately. We need to factor in things like the
individual’s experience in the job vs. in the wider industry, team and company
situation within that period<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, and any potential
biases we might have (this includes things like charisma and manager proximity).

Finally, our review needs to be **actionable**. No matter whether there are
things to improve or we mostly want to stay on our current trajectory, we still
need to set explicit goals to make performance measurable. I also advocate for at
least two levels of goals: goals for satisfactory performance, and goals for
exceptional performance. This makes room for stretch goals while reducing anxiety
about what is necessary vs. good to have.

### No-nos

We should probably also be explicit about what we *don’t* want.

Conversely to our goals above, we do not want to be **vague**, **personal**, or
give **surprise feedback**. These non-goals are just derived from the above.

But there’s more failure modes I’ve seen, often related to problems in middle
management and their KPIs.

Firstly, managers shouldn’t be obligated to hit a quota or give out a certain
number of positive or negative reviews. We’re not doing curve-fitting here.

Secondly, we should keep the number of goals manageable. 20 tiny goals will lead
to less overall change than 3-5 big ticket items. And of course all of them
should be explicit; hidden criteria that only pop up once review rolls around are
embarrassingly common and directly lead to frustration and, consequentially, a
loss of valuable team members.

Finally, we should look at “non-primary” work as well, and reward it. Mentoring,
incident response, reviews, quality documentation should all be rewarded,
especially the higher the report’s level. Of course this must be tailored to the
career track the person is on, especially if there is a “manager” vs. “technical”
track. Again, be as explicit about everything as possible.

## Cadence & format

We should briefly talk about how long our review cycle should be, and how it
should work.

I’ve seen everything from yearly to bi-annual to quarterly. Generally, the
younger the company (and thus faster moving), the shorter the cycles. I’d personally try
to keep the cycles as short as possible organizationally while still providing
enough input into how performance actually trended. Six months is what I see most
often. I personally find a year too slow, but I’ve also never worked at a
corporate behemoth.

The review is informed by two reviews (one by the report and one by the manager),
artifacts the report produced (code, documentation, PRs, incident reports in my
domain), expectations set by our career ladder<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>, as
well as any on-topic 1:1s and ongoing feedback logs we still have. This gives us
more than enough data to figure out a rough trajectory.

You don’t need a formal document for the reviews themselves, but I’ll sketch up
an example that more or less contains all the inputs and output I’d expect:

```
# Performance review <name>: <period>

**Role**: <role with link to description>
**Next follow-up**: <date>

## Summary

<2-3 lines of summary, longer if desired>

### Role alignment

<how did we do in comparison to our ladder, including flagging over-performance>

## Outcomes last period

| Description | Achieved | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
|             | <marker> |       |

## Growth plan next period

- <bulleted list is good enough>
```

## Fin

Reviews are always scary, and it’s probably impossible to make them completely
anxiety-free. But an organization that commits to making growth the goal goes a
long way towards making reviews productive and actually motivate team members
rather than scare them.

In the end, I just want to have people leave the room feeling seen and ready to
tackle the next 3-6 months. If we achieve that, we did most things right.

#### Footnotes

<span id="1">1.</span> It should go without saying that if you had a lot of
attrition or a market crash throw a wrench in our last quarter this should factor
into our performance review and whether we reached our goals. I can tell you,
however, that it doesn’t go without saying.

<span id="2">2.</span> I’ve seen a lot of places that have roles without
descriptions what they actually mean (i.e., staff, senior, and junior handled at
the discretion of the manager). Don’t do that. You don’t have to spell out every
single metric, but having expectations for your roles makes everyone’s lives
easier: managers know what to expect, and reports know what to strive for to
climb the ladder.
