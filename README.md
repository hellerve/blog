# blog

The articles on my personal blog and the tools that power them.

This repository includes a [dead-simple static site generator](https://github.com/hellerve/blog/blob/master/publish.zp)
written in Python, a [distraction-free WYSIWYG Markdown editor](https://github.com/hellerve/blog/tree/master/blargl)
written in Elm, and a [RSS-feed generator and twitter bot (from `index.html`)](https://github.com/hellerve/blog/tree/master/rsser).
The generators are tailored to my specific needs, but the Markdown
editor could be useful for more people. [See it in action here](http://blog.veitheller.de/blargl).

The software is unlicensed and thus you’re free to do whatever you want with
it. The posts themselves are not subject to this license, and you are not
