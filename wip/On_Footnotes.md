’m a huge fan of footnotes, both in print and on the web. I use them all the
time on this blog, and I have a ton of opinions about how to do them right,
though I don’t think I’ve ever spoken about them, let alone justified them.
This blog post intends to do just that.

I’m not a professional writer, typesetter, or designer, though, and while I do
think that I’m okay at stringing words together, I don’t intend to present this
as anything more than my own private opinions. If you have great points that
speak for or against anything I say in this post, please reach out!

## Why Footnotes?

The obvious use for footnotes in more or less academic—or, at least,
well-researched—writing is to create a place where the authors can put their
references without cluttering the flow of the text. While this is a perfect
use case for footnotes, it’s not what I’m concerned with primarily: I don’t
write papers, and my work is of the more light-hearted variety<sup>[1](#1)</sup>.

I personally use footnotes primarily to neatly tuck away nota benes, quips,
jokes, tangentially related thoughts, and anything that would otherwise
distract from the idea at hand. My prose isn’t usually very focused to begin
with, and if I feel like something I’m thinking of while writing is worth
sharing, but maybe not quite in scope, I will write a footnote and get it out
of my system to achieve maximum mental cleanliness.

As such, I don’t expect anyone to read my footnotes. I’m usually the kind of
person that flips to the back of the book or clicks on the link to read through
the footnote, but I know that this is more due to my somewhat obsessive
reading—I’m very much a completionist in that regard. But, as I am that kind of
person, I’ve developed strong opinions about where to put them. Let me elaborate.

## Where to put footnotes

There are many different places for footnotes, and each has its own limitations
and drawbacks. Before I talk about where we could place footnotes and why,
though, I want to talk about an alternative: sidenotes.

### A side note on sidenotes

I personally enjoy sidenotes—some call them marginalia—very much. They’re
unobtrusive, but close enough to the text to not break coherence. My personal
gold standard in books are the books by [Edward
Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/), and my personal favorite is [Beautiful
Evidence](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be). Edward Tufte is a bit of
a cult figure in data science, and for good reason. His thoughts are always worth
reading, and he walks the talk—his books are typeset gorgeously.

On the web, I’m a big fan of [Matthew
Butterick](https://practicaltypography.com/). I bought the typeface that I use
for the code examples, [Triplicate
Code](https://practicaltypography.com/triplicate.html), from him. His fonts are
gorgeous, and I usually listen to his advice when thinking about typographic
design on the web—though I probably get all sorts of things wrong. If you like
his work, [you might want to consider supporting
him](https://practicaltypography.com/how-to-pay-for-this-book.html).

You might have noticed that I don’t use sidenotes on this blog. There’s a good
reason for that: making sidenotes resposnive is not easy. Matthew Butterick puts
his sidenotes in boxes after the annotated paragraph starting at a certain
screen width, but personally I’m not a fan of that solution, since then we’re
back to breaking up the flow of the main text.

So I decided to have footnotes instead of sidenotes on my website. I believe
footnotes to be inferior on big screens, but keeping the style of this website
simple and consistent between screen widths is what’s most important to me. Other
people might have different priorities, and that’s okay.

### Footnote Placement

So, where should we put our footnotes then? If we’re talking about the web, the
answer to that question is simple: on the bottom of the page, connected to the
body through a hyperlink. Some people put return links at the end of their
footnotes, I usually don’t, hoping that the “back” button behaves as it should.
Either way, your notes are nicely hidden to those of our readers who don’t want
to read our non-topical musings, and still easily accessible to those who do.

In books, this question is a little more complex. The three major types of
footnotes I’ve seen are

* on the bottom of the page,
* at the end of the chapter, and
* at the end of the book.

Let’s talk about them one by one.

#### Footnotes at the bottom of the page

Putting your footnotes at the bottom of the page is courteous to readers like me
who want to know what you have to say. When the footnotes get long and stretch
multiple pages, however, reading your footnotes becomes fairly tedious. I’ve seen
footnotes that were longer than the body text on the page, and long footnotes
that dragged on for multiple pages, interspersed by shorter ones that stayed on
the page that referenced them. To me, both options look awkward, but can be used
to great comedic effect, as in the writing of the authors Jorge Luis Borges,
Terry Pratchett, and Walter Moers, to name a few.

#### Footnotes at the end of the chapter

Some authors<span>[2](#2)</span> seem to prefer putting their footnotes at the
end of the chapter. While this provides a natural grouping, I find it to be
tremendously frustrating to search for the end of the chapter every time I want
to see what a footnote has to say—or at least the first time for every chapter.
This might be less of a problem for those of your readers who don’t want to read
them—being a sort of inverse of the bottom-of-the-page design—, but as a lover of
footnotes I find this to be just rude.

#### Footnotes at the end of the book

Having your footnotes at the end of the book, ideally grouped by chapter, is
probably the best compromise: it doesn’t disturb the flow of the page, but
provides a canonical location for all footnotes. We can accomodate both long,
meandering footnotes and short references there. Though this brings me to another
point of greaf for me: mixing footnotes and references.

#### A personal pet peeve

It’s rare that I need to know the source of a thought—though it’s very important
that it’s attributed correctly—, so I don’t usually care about references that much. I’m a casual reader.

As such, it is pretty frustrating to have to look at the back of the book every
time to find out whether there is an interesting thought there or “merely” an
attribution<sup>[3](#3)</sup>. I know I’m guilty of this as well, but I rarely
attribute anything on this blog “properly”, for better or for worse.

### Bottom line: my personal recommendation

To keep things brief<sup>[4](#4)</sup>: I recommend putting both your footnotes
and your references at the end of the book, but separately. I say that as someone
who has never written or published a book, has no experience in typesetting, and
is generally ignorant about the technical aspects of producing books.

## Fin

In the end, none of my musings truly matter: I’m nothing but a semi-voracious
reader with a lot of strong, but weakly-held opinions that I like to share. I do
think that I spent more time thinking about footnotes than most people do, just
because I like them quite a bit. This blog post is meant to be as much a love
letter as it is musings on how to use them and where to put them. I hope you
took something away from it that made you think, and I hope we’ll meet again!

#### Footnotes

<span id="1">1.</span> If you’re the kind of person that believes toying with
                       occult technicalities is light-hearted, which I happen
                       to be.

<span id="2">2.</span> Weirdly, I’ve seen this done most frequently in books
                       written by french philosophers, but that must be a
                       coincidence. Anyway, my editions of Baudrillard’s
                       “Simulacra and Simulation” and Foucault’s “The Order of
                       Things” both exhibit that idiosyncracy.

<span id="3">3.</span> My edition of “Seeing Like a State” by James C. Scott does
                       this, and it annoyed me to no end, so much so that I told
                       my wife, who was the first person who told me that not
                       everyone reads footnotes, a notion that was truly novel
                       to me at the time.

<span id="4">4.</span> Alas, ’tis too late.
