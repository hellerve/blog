For a very long time, Carp didn’t have a mechanism for [quasiquotation](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/04wi/lectures/14-scheme-quote.html).
As a macro writer, this frustrated me to no end, until, finally, I broke down
and wrote an implementation of quasiquotation, in macros. It received a lot of
helpful feedback from the community, and everyone was very excited when it got
merged!

In this blog post I want to both explain what quasiquotation is and how it is
useful, and build a mechanism for quasiquotation with you. While I was
initially afraid it might be a lot of work to build this feature, I actually
was able to get to a working prototype within a few hours. If we work together,
it will hopefully take us even less time!

Let’s get this party started!

## Why quasi? And what is quoting?

If you’ve ever talked to anyone who likes Lisp, you’ve probably heard that its
killer feature is that “code is data”. If your eyes—or ears—start to glaze over
when someone tries to explain the concept, you’re not alone. Still, let me try
and make a short introduction:

```
(defn adder [x y] (+ x y))
```
<div class="figure-label">Fig. 1: An addition function.</div>

In Figure 1, we build a function `adder` that takes two arguments, `x` and `y`,
and adds them together using `+`. But this is also a list! Its first two
elements are the symbols `defn` and `adder`, its third the argument array, and
the last element is the body, which is in itself a list. If we wanted to treat
this list as a data structure rather than as code, all we’d have to do is
prefix it with a quote (`'`).

```
'(defn adder [x y] (+ x y))
```
<div class="figure-label">Fig. 2: Not a function anymore.</div>

We can traverse that list, take elements, rearrange it, all the things we
usually do with our data! This is exciting, because it means that writing a
macro in Lisp is just building a list like that and telling the environment to
evaluate it. We can programmatically generate code!

To do that, however, we often need to make some sections of the structrue
fixed and others flexible. Let’s think of a macro that creates an alias for
a function without arguments, and you will see what I mean:

```
(defmacro alias [new-name original]
  ; we want to emit (defn new-name [] (original))
  (list 'defn new-name [] (list original)))

(defn x [] 1)
(alias y x)
(y) ; => 1
```
<div class="figure-label">Fig. 3: Aliasing functions.</div>

While the code in Figure 3 isn’t terrible, all the calls to `list` get in the
way of understanding the final structure of the code we emit. It doesn’t at all
look like what we want to produce, and it’s ver verbose. Still, this is as good
as it gets if we use `quote`, because it’s an all-or-nothing situation: either
this is code, or it’s data.

This is where quasiquotation comes in. Rather than explaining what it does, let
me just show you, and hopefully it’s somewhat clear:

```
(defmacro alias [new-name original]
  ; we want to emit (defn new-name [] (original))
  `(defn %new-name [] (%original)))

(defn x [] 1)
(alias y x)
(y) ; => 1
```
<div class="figure-label">Fig. 4: Aliasing functions, quasiquote style.</div>

In short, quasiquotation uses `` ` `` as a glyph, and you can intersperse unquoted
values using `%`. There is also another operator, `unquote-splicing` or `%@`,
which will unfold a list of expressions and “splice” it into the parent list.
Again, let’s look at an example:

```
(defdynamic x '(1 2))

; using unquote is not quite enough
`(+ %x) ; => (+ (1 2))

; unquote-splicing works!
`(+ %@x) ; => (+ 1 2)
```
<div class="figure-label">Fig. 5: `unquote-splicing` in action.</div>

This should hopefully make quotation and quasiquotation quite clear. You can
refer [to the Carp documentation](https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp/blob/master/docs/Quasiquotation.md)
or [the API docs](https://carp-lang.github.io/carp-docs/core/Quasiquote.html)
to see an alternative explanation, although as of now they’ve all been written
by yours truly.

We are almost ready to try and implement this ourselves, but one piece is
missing: how do we implement these weird glyphs? They don’t seem to work like
regular functions!

All the glyphs we looked at are “reader macros”. This means that all Carp does
is rewrite the expressions to `quasiquote`, `unquote`, and `unquote-splicing`
forms. What would this look like? Let’s look at the code from Figure 5 again:

```
`(+ %x)
; expands to (quasiquote (+ (unquote x)))

`(+ %@x)
; expands to (quasiquote (+ (unquote-splicing x)))
```
<div class="figure-label">Fig. 6: The reader macros.</div>

That means we can implement this in regular Carp after all, by implementing
normal macros and functions.

Let’s get to work then!

## Implementing `quasiquote`

Before we start, I’d like to point out that this is not a tutorial for writing
macros. While it’s certainly possible to follow along without really knowing
how macros work, it might be a little much, and I don’t want to frustrate you.
There are many good resources on macros, I personally like [Colin Jones’ book
on Clojure macros](https://pragprog.com/titles/cjclojure/mastering-clojure-macros/).
If you are a little more advanced and want some more mind-bending stuff, I’m
quite proud of [my little series of blog posts](https://blog.veitheller.de/scheme-macros/)
on language features implemented as Scheme macros.

Now let’s write some code, shall we?

```
(defmacro unquote [form]
  (macro-error "unquotes need to be wrapped inside quasiquotes."))

(defmacro unquote-splicing [form]
  (macro-error "unquotes need to be wrapped inside quasiquotes."))
```
<div class="figure-label">Fig. 7: Baby’s first error.</div>

This might be a little anti-climactic, but we need to ensure that `unquote` and
`unquote-splicing` forms are always wrapped inside `quasiquote`s. The two
macros above will be called when lone unquotes are found, and report this as an
error.

The implementation of `quasiquote` is where it’s at, so let’s write a little
skeleton

```
(defndynamic quasiquote- [form]
  ; magic happens here
)

(defmacro quasiquote [form]
 (quasiquote- form))
```
<div class="figure-label">Fig. 8: A skeleton for `quasiquote`.</div>

In the macro, we will actually just call a dynamic function to do all the work.
I find that this is good practice unless a macro is a simple rewrite, since
functions are much more reusable, and it’s easier to think about recursive
functions than about recursive macros<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.

So, what do we have  to do? `quasiquote` will need to traverse its body to see
what needs to be unquoted and what can remain the same.

```
(defndynamic quasiquote- [form]
  (cond
    (and (list? form) (> (length form) 0))
      (quasiquote-list form)
    (array? form)
      (collect-into (map quasiquote- form) array)
    (list 'quote form)))
```
<div class="figure-label">Fig. 8: Quasiquoting, by case.</div>

Alright, let’s look at the cases! If it’s a non-empty list, we call
`quasiquote-list` on it, a function we haven’t defined yet, but that will
presumably take care of the list for us. If it’s an array, we just call
`quasiquote-` on each of the elements and put the result in an array again,
and otherwise we quote the argument, since it’s not inside an unquoted form.
So far, so good!

Our workhorse `quasiquote-list` will have to deal with a little more at once.
Let’s look at it!

```
(defndynamic quasiquote-list [form]
  (let [app (car form)]
   (cond
     (= app 'quasiquote) form

     (and (= app 'unquote) (= (length form) 2))
       (cadr form)
     (= app 'unquote)
       (macro-error "unquote takes exactly one argument.")

     (map quasiquote- form))))
```
<div class="figure-label">Fig. 9: Quasiquoting a list.</div>

I’ve omitted dealing with `unquote-splicing` for now, since it will complicate
matters a little bit. For now, we just look at the first element of the list.
If it is another `quasiquote` form, we leave it as is. The next time the macro
expander runs, it will expand this nested quasiquotation, but it’s not our
business. If it’s an `unquote` form and it only has one element, we just return
that element using `cadr`. Otherwise, the `unquote` form is malformed and we
return an error. If we haven’t encountered a special form, we just run
`quasiquote-` on all the forms in `form` to ensure that any nested lists also
get expanded.

This works, and is quite elegant and simple. Sadly, this will break down a
little once we have to deal with `unquote-splicing`. This is somewhat obvious
when you think about the current implementation: we just walk the form
recursively, either leaving it untouched or replacing elements, but the
structure is unchanged. This is different with splices: we need to change the
enclosing structure of the splice.

Where is the crux of the problem then? It’s the last line of Figure 9, where
we use `map`. We will have to change this to a more involved traversal. In my
implementation of quasiquotation, I opted for `reduce`. Let me show you the
magic incantation, and then we stick it back into `quasiquote-list`.

```
(reduce
 (fn [acc elem]
   (if (and* (list? elem)
             (= (length elem) 2)
             (= (car elem) 'unquote-splicing))
     (list 'append acc (cadr elem))
     (list 'cons-last (quasiquote- elem) acc)))
 '()
 form))))
```
<div class="figure-label">Fig. 10: Magic.</div>

This is a little much, and I apologize. But all we’re really doing is going
over a list, and for each element we check for any sublists that are two
elements long and start with `unquote-splicing`. If they do, we use `append`
to stick them to our result list, which will flatten it (this is the crux!).
In all other cases, we essentially resort to what we did with `map`: call
`quasiquote-` on the list element and stick it at the end of the list.

All we have to do now is add two error cases for `unquote-splicing` in our
list handling function, and stick our magic bit at the end:

```
(defndynamic quasiquote-list [form]
  (let [app (car form)]
   (cond
     (= app 'quasiquote) form

     (and (= app 'unquote) (= (length form) 2))
       (cadr form)
     (= app 'unquote)
       (macro-error "unquote takes exactly one argument.")

     (and (= app 'unquote-splicing)
          (= (length form) 2))
       (macro-error "unquote-splicing needs an enclosing list.")
     (= app 'unquote-splicing)
       (macro-error "unquote-splicing takes exactly one argument.")

     (reduce
       (fn [acc elem]
         (if (and* (list? elem)
                   (= (length elem) 2)
                   (= (car elem) 'unquote-splicing))
           (list 'append acc (cadr elem))
           (list 'cons-last (quasiquote- elem) acc)))
       '()
       form))))
```
<div class="figure-label">Fig. 11: Quasiquoting a list in full.</div>

The two error cases we’re dealing with is when we find a lone
`unquote-splicing`, in which we report that it needs to be part of a list,
and a malformed one, similar to how dealt with `unquote` above.

And that’s it! We can `quasiquote` and `unquote` all we like! Pretty excting,
huh?

## Fin

While this might have been a little dense, I still find it instructive to look
at something like this, something that you might have no idea how to implement,
and just go through it. It’s a fantastic way to learn, and I use it all the
time<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>!

I hope this has been as helpful to you as I hoped, and I’ll see you soon!

<span id="1">1.</span> If you like recursive macros, [my series on Scheme
macros](https://blog.veitheller.de/scheme-macros/) is for you!

<span id="2">2.</span> I most recently used it to understand how one would
implement something like Datalog (spoiler: it’s almost the same as miniKanren),
and went through [the Racket implementation](github.com/racket/datalog). It’s
a fantastically simple little implementation of Datalog, and it took away all
the fear and doubt that I had. In fact, just a week later I gave a one hour
wealkthrough of the implementation to a paper reading group that got pretty
good feedback!
