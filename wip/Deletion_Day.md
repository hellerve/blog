One of my fellow [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com/) alums shared a
wonderful idea—which shouldn’t be a surprise, considering that the Recurse
Center community is probably the most inspired community I know. For a few
years, they’ve made April 4th “Deletion Day”, a day focused on deleting and
cleaning up. This year they made [a website for it](https://deletionday.com/).

I enjoy this concept. I enjoy making myself vulnerable and being open, and I
hope that this blog reflects that. But I like to do so on my own terms. I’m not
particularly active on any social network these days, apart from Github. While
you can find bits and pieces of information about me scattered all over the
web—I wasn’t always as vigilant about curating my online persona as I am now,
and the internet reminds me of that<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.

So what am I doing for this deletion day?

Github and its community has been good to me. I’ve gotten a lot of support and
friendly messages about my work over the years, and I don’t intend to
significantly scale down my activity there. But sometimes curating this profile
does feel lie a chore, like an obligation. In an effort to counter that I set
up [my own instance of Gitea](https://veitheller.de/git). Most of my Carp
libraries already have their main home there, and Github only has mirrors of
these repositories. Over the course of this year, I’d like to make that true
for more and more of my work. It will be less explorable, perhaps. It will be
less siloed, surely. And I get to dictate the terms of what to share, which is
what is most important to me.

With all of that said, this year’s deletion day will be spent moving some of
my repositories that noone cares about to begin with over to my Gitea server.
I have an irrational fear of rendering my online persona less appealing by
moving things out of the public eye, and by losing those terrible and addictive
green cubes on my profile.

I’m very easily tricked into optimizing for leaderboards and statistics. I
don’t want my life to be influenced by them as much as they are right now,
though, and I think taking a step back would be good for me. So that’s what
I’m going to do.

Happy deletion day, everyone!

#### Footnotes

<span id="1">1</span> Having a fairly uncommon name further complicates things,
                      but I like my name a lot and wouldn’t want to change it
                      ever. Every name comes with its own benefits and
                      drawbacks, I suppose.
