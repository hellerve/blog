      <h1>GDPR Notice</h1>
      <p>
        This is the personal blog of Veit Heller. As such, I am not required to
        have a GDPR notice. Nonetheless, I will provide a notice that helps you
        find out what this blog stores and knows about you. I don’t expect it to
        be legally airtight.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website does not store any personally identifiable information.
        It collects the requesting party’s IP address and user agent from the
        HTTP request, but does not store them.
      </p>
      <p>
        One external snippet is loaded from the
        <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>. It will record
        your IP address and, when clicked, redirect you to an external website
        that I have no control over. It also loads an asset from Cloudfront,
        which is an AWS service. Information about GDPR compliance of AWS
        services can be found
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center/?nc1=h_ls">
          here
        </a>.

<h2 id="analytics">Web analytics (Plausible)</h2>
<p>
  This site uses <a href="https://plausible.io">Plausible Analytics</a>. Plausible works without cookies
  and without cross-site tracking. No personal data is stored.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Per pageview captured:</strong> page URL (without query params except common campaign tags),
      referrer, and derived browser/OS/device type; city-level location is inferred from the IP.</li>
  <li><strong>No raw identifiers stored:</strong> Plausible does not store IP addresses or full user-agents.
      For daily unique counts it uses a hash of a rotating salt + domain + IP + UA; the salt is deleted
      every 24 hours.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal basis:</strong> Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest) in lightweight, privacy-preserving
      reach measurement and site improvement.</li>
  <li><strong>Processor & hosting:</strong> Plausible Insights OÜ (Estonia, EU). Data are processed and stored
      in the EU on servers in Germany (Hetzner). No transfers outside the EU.</li>
  <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Only aggregated statistics are kept for as long as the site is active.
      You can contact me if you have questions regarding this processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Public stats:</strong> For transparency, I made the statistics publicly available <a href="https://plausible.io/blog.veitheller.de">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
