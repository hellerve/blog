Still, there is an implicit assumption that some of the basics are done right, and I’ve seen a lot of seemingly small issues over the years that repeat themselves enough to warrant a word of caution. And that is what I intend to provide in this blog post."

				"string" : "- **Only meeting with the “senior officers”. **Most teams will have more senior and junior people. Your job is to meet with all of them. You want to amplify the quiet voices, and hear everyone out. This is not a product or architecture session; we’re having a check-in.\n- **Substituting 1:1s for pairing or product sessions.** Regular pair-programming or product sessions are great, but they are focused on something else; you can still get a feeling for how the other person is doing, but they won’t suddenly start airing their grievances about their deskmate’s loud keyboard and the fact that they saw someone else’s payslip and the difference hit them like a haymaker. You’re working on the product, and there is limited room for other topics.\n- **Holding on tightly to the agenda.** Setting an agenda is important, but the report’s topics are always more important. This is not a space for corporate box-ticking.\n- **Trying to unify the process across team members.** People are different. Some people will need a while to warm up, some people will get stuck into it from the get-go. Some people need the same structure every time, some people need the freedom to let their thoughts flow. All of it is okay, and can easily be accommodated.\n- **Talking too much.** This is the one point where I personally disagree with some of the sources I shared above. The report should get ample talking room; the manager gets to listen. 25–35% talking time is plenty, most of the time should be spent listening."
